# Synthetic-Apature-Radar-Data
Give full description here of what SAR is, include some images of the different types of reflections and refractions and the types of data you can extract from this. 

# Exploring STAC Metadata
#### SpotioTemporal Asset Catalog
https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec
Describe what is included in STAC and how this will help us determine which data (which images) are useful to us for finding data that we want to extract. e.g. if we want to analyse ground movement around volcanos we can check STAC files to see which SAR images we would need to extract. 
Not sure if best way to do this is to make some sort of sql database from the STAC files so it is easily explorable via QSL?
